# Reapeated Characters (Optimized)

Write a function called `repeatedChars` that receives two strings and returns a new string with the characters that are repeated in both input strings:

```javascript
repeatedChars("german", "gabriela"); // "gear"
```

**Note:** Use an object to store all the characters of the first string and then iterate throught the second string using the object to search for the characters. The complexity should be O(max_length(n,m)).
