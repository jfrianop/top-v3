//Pseudocode
//There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. 
//Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.
//
//The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. 
//Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). 
//If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.
//
//Input: a string where each character is a command.
//Output: returns true if the final position is 0.0, returns false otherwise.
//Instructions:
//1. Initialize the variables of position x, y = 0
//2. run the string, adding or dedycting the position depending on the string
//3. Return true if both x and y = o, false otherwise;

//Function judgeCircle
function judgeCircle(moves) {
    let x=0;
    let y=0;
    for(let i = 0;i<moves.length;i++){
        switch(moves[i]){
            case "U":
                y++;
                break;
            case "D":
                y--;
                break;
            case "R":
                x++;
                break;
            case "L":
                x--;
                break;
        }
    }
    return ((x===0)&&(y===0))
